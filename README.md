# Java-Workshops
The repository includes basic Java concepts to more advanced topics. Starting from scratch, you will learn about variables, data types, control structures, loops, arrays and functions. As you progress, more complex topics such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism and exception handling will be explored.

# Learning Java

Welcome to the Learning Java repository!

This repository has been created with the aim of providing you with a comprehensive set of resources and learning materials to learn and master the Java programming language. Whether you are an absolute beginner or have previous programming experience, you will find suitable content for your level and be able to progress at your own pace.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Introduction to Java**: Here you will find a complete introduction to the Java language, including setting up the development environment, configuration, and the first "Hello World" program.

2. **Java Fundamentals**: In this section, we cover the core concepts of Java, such as variables, data types, operators, control structures (conditionals and loops), and input/output handling.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: This section focuses on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

4. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Here we explore different data structures (lists, sets, maps, etc.) and common algorithms in Java. We learn how to implement and utilize these structures to solve problems.

5. **Practical Applications**: In this section, we put our learning into practice by developing real-world applications and projects using Java. We also learn about file handling, databases, and network connections.

6. **Additional Resources**: In this section, you will find links to useful external resources, such as books, online tutorials, recommended courses, and programming communities.
